	<h1> Cycle Trip </h1>
	<p>
		Documenting my trip around the US on my
		very own Cycle!
	</p>

		Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
		through some interesting places on the way: 
	</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Walla Walla,WA</li>
			<li>Magic City, ID</li>
			<li>Bountiful, UT</li>
			<li>Last Chance, CO</li>
			<li>Why, AZ</li>
			<li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
		</ol>

	<h2> July 14, 2005 </h2>
	<p>
		I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of
		the road today: 
	</p>
		<blockquote>
			Passing cars, <br>
			When you can&#39t see,<br>
			May get you,<br>
			A glimpse,<br> 
			Of eternity.<br>
		</blockquote>
	<p>
		I definitely won&#39t be passing any cars!
	</p>

	<h2>June 2, 2005</h2>

	<p>
		My first day of the trip! I can&#39t believe finally
		got everything packed and ready to go. Because
		I&#39m on a <strong> Cycle </strong>, I wasn&#39t able to bring a whole
		lot with me:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>cellphone</li>
		<li>iPod</li>
		<li>digital camera</li>
		<li>protein bar</li>
	</ul>
	<p>	
		Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu
		would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles
		begins with one <em>Cycle</em>.</q>
